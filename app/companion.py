"""Sparky Bot: a personal companion that remembers you, learns your style and grows with you.

- every reply is built from: persona + relationship level + style profile + the memories that matter
  right now (hybrid search) + a rolling summary of older conversations + follow-ups to bring up;
- after each exchange, a background pass extracts durable facts about the user (add / update / delete,
  like Mem0) and refines the style profile;
- when idle, the bot "reflects": merges duplicates, updates the summary, writes a journal entry and
  prepares what to ask next time (like OpenAI Dots' background work). Everything stays inspectable.

Today is {today}.
Rules:
- Keep only durable, useful facts the USER stated about themselves: identity (name, age, job, city), preferences and dislikes, projects, people and pets in their life, goals, important events, health or diet constraints, how they like to be talked to.
- NEVER store anything that only the Assistant said or assumed. Ignore chit-chat, compliments, the assistant's suggestions, and temporary states ("I'm tired today" -> at most a mood).
- Write each memory as one short third-person sentence IN {lang}, with the user's name if known (e.g. "Anis has a cat named Pixel.").
- Dates: turn relative dates into absolute ones using today's date ("Tuesday" -> "Tuesday 20 October 2026"). When an event from memory has now happened, UPDATE it with the outcome (e.g. "Anis met an investor on 20 October 2026; it went well and a second meeting is planned.").
- ONE fact per memory. Never merge several facts into one memory, never rewrite a memory to add unrelated facts.
- If the new information changes, completes or contradicts an existing memory about the SAME fact, UPDATE that memory (use its id). Leave all other memories alone. Never add something already covered by an existing memory.
- If the user asks you to forget something, DELETE the matching memory ids.
- importance: 5 = core identity/strong constraint, 3 = useful, 1 = minor.
- style: when the user shows or asks how they want to be talked to, also fill style keys (tone, length, language, formality, humor, emojis, notes) with short values. {} if nothing new.
Return ONLY JSON: {"add":[{"text":"...","category":"identity|preference|project|people|goal|event|style|other","importance":3}],
